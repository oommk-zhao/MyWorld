August 28 2024, we are now in the ObjectsManager::createTrialWorld
    - Create GraphicsObject related part
    - How to create/initialize Graphics things?
        - In Object Manager(just a name, not the real manager in the project) (Okay, there is one ObjectsManager, but it is a temporary solution),
          keep QGraphicsObject, and make XXXXGraphicsComponent as QObject.
        - Keep QGraphicsObject inside QObject is for the purpose, that hide the implementation of graphics system.
        - Using QObject, is we need its signal/slot system.
        - Same structure for Graphics View and Graphics Scene
    - Where shall we store the GraphicsViewObject and GraphicsSceneObject?
        - In Trial world, we keep GraphicsViewObject and GraphicsSceneObject inside worldBGWindow.
        - I am not sure whether this is a good idea, might be better to put them inside ObjectManager.
        - We may have more than single GraphicsScene and GraphicsView.
            - If so, to use worldBGWindow to maintain might be a bad idea.
    
    - Now let's create graphics objects! In the Object manager
