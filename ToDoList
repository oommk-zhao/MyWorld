August 28 2024, we are now in the ObjectsManager::createTrialWorld
    - Create GraphicsObject related part
    - How to create/initialize Graphics things?
        - In Object Manager(just a name, not the real manager in the project) (Okay, there is one ObjectsManager, but it is a temporary solution),
          keep QGraphicsObject, and make XXXXGraphicsComponent as QObject.
        - Keep QGraphicsObject inside QObject is for the purpose, that hide the implementation of graphics system.
        - Using QObject, is we need its signal/slot system.
        - Same structure for Graphics View and Graphics Scene
    - Where shall we store the GraphicsViewObject and GraphicsSceneObject?
        - In Trial world, we keep GraphicsViewObject and GraphicsSceneObject inside worldBGWindow.
        - I am not sure whether this is a good idea, might be better to put them inside ObjectManager.
        - We may have more than single GraphicsScene and GraphicsView.
            - If so, to use worldBGWindow to maintain might be a bad idea.
    
    - Now let's create graphics objects! In the Object manager
    
    - Not using static_cast pattern to convert basic class into specific one, which make abstract no sense.
    
    - Using worldBGWindow to initialize whole graphics things, in the Trial world version.
    
    - Using Instance Manager, to hold all Instance required Objects.
      But! Only Instance Manager is the Instance. For the purpose that reduce the number of instance objects.

September 7th 2024, now are creating the graphics world
    - General Objects can inheirt from QOjbect. Qt is a big feature of "MyWorld".
      We can hide detail implementation behind. However, QObject with Q_OBJECT can be explicit, due to we need Signal and Slot.
      On the other hand, when we will not use Qt anymore, we anyway will change signal/slot system, which means, the modification cannot be avoided.
    - The Graphics View and Scene have hard code geometry, will be improved during Trial world development.
    - CAUTION! Graphics Scene and View both have event available. Events defined on these two Objects can bring different Result.
      Think over more when defining the events
      
September 8th 2024, to initialize GraphicsView, Scene and Objects correctly, then show them.
    - learn the information of QGraphicsWidget.
    
9/22 2024, no necessary to define SceneRectangle in Trial version. As by default, the SceneRectangle is dynamicly changed/created/modified by Qt.
           neither for QGraphicsView
    - Now, add the graphics items! But to is the proper way?
    - Go deeper into the Factory mode and related things/topics.
    - In parallel, in Trial, we use static_cast first.
