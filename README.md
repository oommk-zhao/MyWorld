# MyWorld

I now use C++, Qt 6.x, to create the exact true application/Game from the prototype "GodlikeAct".

Not only to practice, also to implement/use, the TDD, C++14/17, Qt 6.x, QML, QtTest, CMake. Hopefully, Python.

- TDD, the main process of the application/Game, I will use TDD. The Red->Green->Reconstruction.
- C++14/17, the main thing to learn/use, is the Lamda.
- Qt 6.x, please try to use the new features.
- Qt Test, to use this to write test case.
- CMake, makefile.
- Python, for the test part.

Let's move!

/** 2023.10.8 **/

Copy and move constructor and operator = have been tested.
We now is on the stage of creating the land objects, the Map!
