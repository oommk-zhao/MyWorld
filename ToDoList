August 28 2024, we are now in the ObjectsManager::createTrialWorld
    - Create GraphicsObject related part
    - How to create/initialize Graphics things?
        - In Object Manager(just a name, not the real manager in the project) (Okay, there is one ObjectsManager, but it is a temporary solution),
          keep QGraphicsObject, and make XXXXGraphicsComponent as QObject.
        - Keep QGraphicsObject inside QObject is for the purpose, that hide the implementation of graphics system.
        - Using QObject, is we need its signal/slot system.
        - Same structure for Graphics View and Graphics Scene
    - Where shall we store the GraphicsViewObject and GraphicsSceneObject?
